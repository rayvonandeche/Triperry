PROJECT: TRIPPERRY

App Description:
Tripperry is a comprehensive travel planning application similar to TripAdvisor but with an AI-powered recommendation system backed by real-time data from on-site travel agents. The app aims to consolidate all travel-related services into one platform, eliminating the need to visit multiple sites when planning trips.
This a prototype and we'll use dummy data (Mostly Kenyan) for the MVP.

Key Features:
- AI-powered travel planning assistant is the selling point of the app
- Personalized travel recommendations based on user preferences
- Real-time destination information updated by on-site agents
- Comprehensive planning tools for various travel scenarios:
    - Romantic getaways and dates
    - Group tours and excursions
    - Family vacations
    - Business trips and conferences
    - Solo adventures

Design Philosophy:
- Clean, intuitive UI with emphasis on visual content (destination photos, maps).Gradeints,opacity,shadows and light borders should be used to create depth and focus on important elements.
- User-frienly navigation and interactivity especially in the Ai screen.
- Integration of AI features to enhance user experience without overwhelming them.
- Seamless user experience across all planning stages
- Accessibility for users of all technical proficiency levels

Technical Requirements:
- Flutter for cross-platform compatibility
- State management using [preferred approach]
- Integration with maps and location services
- AI recommendation engine
- Real-time data synchronization
